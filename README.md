# The-Coding-Library-
A library of programming books to help beginner programmers in the their preferred programming language.  
The aim for this project is to create a "library" of beginner/intermediate programming books of various programming languages. Aiming to using a Graphical User interface (which may include imaages of books) that users can view then choose if they wish to rent out book or not. May include some audio as well. Book information will stored utilzing an ArrayList. This project idea may be tweaked or changed entirely. 

List of Contributors: Kenneth Elmore, Trinity Young, and Ryan Roberts. 

Discussed as a team and came up with three classes (as of now) that will be the basis of the library project. 

Kenneth: A class that handles the creation of each "book" object.
Trinity: A class that handles taking the book objects and placing them in an ArrayList, which will also inform the user if the book is checked out or not. 
Ryan: Creating the central portion of the project, giving the user options to take books out, check them in, and check the status of the entered book. 

Class creation assignments may be subject to change.
